# diskwinds

This repository contains an adaptation of the [Disk-Wind-Density-Program](https://github.com/K1zum1/Disc-Wind-Density-Program)

It is recommended to make a new folder for each model you run, first copying the base files folder and modifying from there. Unless you are looking to change how the disk wind characteristics are calculated, you should only modify the parameters.py folder.

To use, follow these steps:
1. Make a copy of the base_files directory and rename it to your desired model name 
2. Navigate to the model directory and make any desired modifications to the parameters.py input file
3. Run the execute file to generate an image of your model (run 'python3 execute.py' in the command line within your desired directory)
