# diskwinds

This repository contains an adaptation of the Disk-Wind-Density-Program by Jae Chong.

Unless you are looking to change how the disk wind characteristics are calculated, you should not need to change anything other then parameters.py

Currently, this program is only capable of modeling a single molecule/atom at a time.
